# Global Supply Chain Optimization and Predictive Risk Analytics
**Cloud-to-Desktop Data Pipeline: Databricks (Spark SQL) and Power BI**

## Project Overview
This project addresses systemic logistics challenges by analyzing a global supply chain dataset containing over 180,000 transactions. I engineered a scalable data pipeline to identify delivery bottlenecks, seasonal volatility, and financial "Revenue at Risk." The project demonstrates the transition from raw, unstructured data to executive-level strategic insights.

## Technical Architecture
* **Data Engineering (Cloud):** Leveraged Databricks and Spark SQL for distributed data processing. Performed Extract, Transform, Load (ETL) tasks including schema standardization, data type casting, and feature engineering of performance indicators.
* **Business Intelligence:** Developed a robust semantic model in Power BI using Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) to create advanced time-intelligence and performance measures.
* **Version Control:** Managed technical assets via Git to ensure documentation integrity and code reproducibility.

## Strategic Business Insights
* **Logistics Efficiency:** Established a global 54.83% late delivery baseline, indicating a requirement for systemic supply chain optimization.
* **Product Performance Outliers:** Identified the "Golf Bags and Carts" category as a primary bottleneck, with a statistically significant 68.8% delay rate.
* **Geospatial Intelligence:** Pinpointed Western Europe as the primary revenue-generating market, while identifying it as a high-risk zone for logistics volatility.
* **Seasonality Analysis:** Discovered recurring performance degradation during June and December, signaling a requirement for seasonal capacity scaling and predictive planning.

## Repository Technical Assets
* **Supply_Chain_Logic.ipynb:** Documentation of Spark SQL transformations and data cleaning logic.
* **Supply_Chain_Architecture.pbix:** The core Power BI data model and interactive visualization layers.
* **Executive_Summary.png:** High-resolution overview of the finalized analytics dashboard.

## Strategic Recommendations
1. **Carrier Audit:** Conduct a logistics performance review for the Western European "Golf" category to mitigate potential customer churn.
2. **Resource Allocation:** Implement a 30-day buffer strategy ahead of the identified June and December peak demand windows to align actual delivery dates with scheduled targets.
